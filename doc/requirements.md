# Test Task

## Task

Develop a scripting language interpreter for testing shared functions libraries. A program should be developed with C language usage as a console application for the OS GNU/Linux (x86 processor architecture) with API POSIX.1-2001 usage.

## Scripting Language Syntax

The script file is a text file with an arbitrary name. The rule applies: one line is one command.

There are two commands in the language:

1. **Loading the library**
   > use <so_name>

   - `<so_name>`: the path to the file *.so
   - Possible errors:
     - the file not found;
     - the file is not a shared library.

2. **Library function call**
   > call <func_name>

   - `<func_name>`: the name of the function
   - Possible errors:
     - the function is not found;
     - the library is not loaded.

Syntax errors must be accompanied by interpreter warnings and must not cause the script to stop executing. In case of command execution error – execution of the script is terminated.

Additionally, you can implement support for comments ('#', ';') and line breaks ('\') and interactive mode of the application (entering commands directly from the terminal).

## Description of Test Libraries
All test libraries should be developed with C language usage. All exported functions should have the prototype:


## Requirements to the application:

The application should be launched from the command line with only one parameter – the path to the file script. An example:

>	sotest test.sc

Example of the script:

```terminal
use test.so
call example
call test1_func
use other.so
call func1
```

### The result of the test task:

* Application source code (compilation instruction should be included)
* Self-testing result of the application (to demonstrate that the application works properly in candidate’s own machine), including:
  * Screenshot/console output of the application execution
  * The script ( .sc file ) used for testing
  * The source of the libraries used for testing
